change outline shader screenSize to be a call to textureSize
replace current SunShadow func with shader from https://github.com/Theo-Bradley/Supermaket-Scramble/blob/master/proj/game/Assets/Shaders/s_FragmentToon.frag
Maybe anti alias the shadow map?????
maybe draw first then do shadow pass after (no self shadowing)? use dir light for sun
